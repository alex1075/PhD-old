This is the repository regarding the PhD of Alexander Hunt at the University of Edinburgh

Python3, gcc/glang and bash required 
  Nvidia CUDA GPU or AMD RadeonOpenCompute GPU prefereable unless using Apple M ARM CPU
    Intel CPU also prefered over AMD (SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA)

Roadmap:

 -> recognition of sample components
	-> test with different architectures of ML
		-> SMV
		-> Random forests
		-> image classification
		-> object detection 
		-> metadata analysis 
 -> enumeration of components within field of view
	-> use of IDs and bash scripting for calculation (may migrate to cpp)
 -> detection of signs of infection (TBD)
